**Viral Nucleosomes Starting Structures**
-


The viral nucleosome-like particle was modeled from PDB 7N8N, wrapped with Widom 601 DNA. The deposited Cryo-EM structure only resolves 129 of the expected 147 base pairs, DNA extensions were manually built in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD). 

Targeted MD was applied to guide the system toward a closed, fully wrapped conformation based on the 1KX5 structure.
