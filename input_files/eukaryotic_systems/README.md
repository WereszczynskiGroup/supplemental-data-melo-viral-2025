**Eukaryotic Nucleosomes Starting Structures**

The full-length eukaryotic model was based on the PDB 1KX5.

The truncated eukaryotic system was generated by deleting the disordered N- and C- terminal tail regions of each histone: 
- 42 residues from H3
- 28 residues from H4
- 43 residues from H2A
- 32 residues from H2B

Truncations were applied to the N-termini of all histones, and to the C-terminus of H2A, consistent with previous tail-deletion protocols.
