# Figures

Publication-ready or analysis-stage figures derived from simulation results.

Suggested:
- Vector plots (`.svg`, `.pdf`)
- High-resolution raster images (`.png`)
- Source data (e.g., `.csv`) for each plot
- Code or script reference used to generate each figure

Maintain filename correspondence with manuscript figure panels if applicable (e.g., `fig2_contacts.svg`).
