Histone RMSD results
-

The output files of the RMSD timeseries for each histone type (H4, H3, H2A, H2B) are found in their respective systems folder. Files containing the average RMSD value for each histone are also located here, of which are combined to one file as intermediate results and used for barplot creation for comparisons across systems.

Protein types (viral, eukaryotic, and truncated eukaryotic) as well as DNA types (widom 601 and alpha-satellite DNA) results are compared in barplots in the same plot.
