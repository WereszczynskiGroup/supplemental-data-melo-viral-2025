2D RMSD Heatmaps + Histogram Plotting
-

Each 2D-RMSD script plots heatmaps for both copies of the connector (H4-H3 or H2B-H2A) over the course of the simulation. 

The histogram plotting script calculates the normalized frequency of the RMSD for each connector as well as plots the histogram for each DNA type.
