Hydrogen Bond Occupancies
-

Utilized VMD to processed hbond_counts to count how often each residue forms H-bonds across the system replicas, then normalized over the total frames to get occupancy values.
PDB files provided have the hydrogen bond occupancy values in the b-factor column.

Each occupancy value was then assigned to the B-factor column of a reference PDB file for the viral structure and eukaryotic structure.
