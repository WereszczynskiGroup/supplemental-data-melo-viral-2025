Hydrogen Bond Occupancies
-

Utilized VMD to process hydrogen bonds counts to account for how often each residue forms these bonds across the system replicas, then normalized these values over the total frame count to get occupancy values.
PDB files provided have the hydrogen bond occupancy values in the b-factor column.

Each occupancy value was then assigned to the B-factor column of a reference PDB file for the viral structure and eukaryotic structure.
