MM/GBSA Binding Free Energy Calculations
-

Folders for each nucleosome structure (viral, eukaryotic, truncated eukaryotic) with either DNA sequence (widom 601 or alpha-satellite dna) contain binding free energy calculations between segments within the nucleosome structure. The initial files assigned a set of residues as the "ligand" and another as the "receptor", as part of the complex structure in the single-trajectory approach for MM/GBSA calculations.

MM/GBSA calculations are seperated into the different complexes analyzed:
- Protein-DNA Complex containing the entire structure
- Protein-DNA Complex containing the entire truncated eukaryotic system, the equivalent region in the canonical eukaryotic system, and all but histone connector residues for the viral system
- Histone tail/connector - DNA Complex (only calculated for canonical eukaryotic system and viral system)

Inefficiency test is performed using decoorelation time of 100ns, providing the final values used for the MM/GBSA tables in the paper main text and SI.
