Total DNA Unwrapping of Viral and Eukarytoic Nucleosomes
-
Output files provided were calculating using bp_unwrapping.py located in the analysis folder for Figure 2. Data contains timeseries data of the unwrapped status of each basepair over the course of the simulation. 

Plotting scripts calculate the total number of basepairs unwrapped at a time. A Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter with a first-degree polynomial and a 100 ns window is also applied to smooth the unwrapping data.
