Angular Motion of Dimers Relative to Nucleosome Tetramer Subunit
-

The python script plots the change in angle the nucleosome dimer has from the H4-H3 tetramer throughout the simulation, allowing for comparisons across protein types (viral, eukaryotic, and truncated eukaryotic) and DNA types (widom 601 and alpha-satellite DNA) with replica simulations in the same plot.
