Entry and Exit DNA Unwrapping of Viral and Eukaryotic Nucleosomes
-
Output files provided were calculating using bp_unwrapping.py located in the analysis folder for Figure 2. Data contains timeseries data of the unwrapped status of each basepair over the course of the simulation for the 73 basepairs on either the Entry DNA or Exit DNA end. 

Plotting scripts calculate the total number of basepairs unwrapped at a time for each end. A Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter with a first-degree polynomial and a 100 ns window is also applied to smooth the unwrapping data.

Data divided into folders for Protein type (viral, eukaryotic, and truncated eukaryotic) and DNA type (widom 601 and alpha-satellite dna).
