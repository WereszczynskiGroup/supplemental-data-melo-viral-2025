# Results

Processed data output from the analysis scripts.

Examples:
- CSV files with RMSD, radius of gyration, or hydrogen bond metrics
- Time series for individual observables
- Intermediate results used for figure generation

Raw trajectories or large binary files (e.g., `*.dcd`, `*.nc`, `*.xtc`) should not be stored hereâ€”deposit in long-term storage or a data archive service.

Each file should be labeled clearly with the simulation condition or replica.
