RMSD of H2B–H2A dimers relative to H4–H3 tetramer across systems
-
The python script plots the timeseries of the RMSD changes of the nucleosome dimer from the tetramer, allowing for comparisons across protein types (viral, eukaryotic, and truncated eukaryotic) and DNA types (widom 601 and alpha-satellite DNA) in the same plot.
