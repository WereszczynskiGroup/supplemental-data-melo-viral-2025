RMSD of H2B–H2A dimers relative to H4–H3 tetramer across systems
-
The python script provided plots tracking fluctuations of the nucleosome dimer from the tetramer, comparing across protein types (viral, eukaryotic, and truncated eukaryotic) and DNA types (widom 601 and alpha-satellite DNA) with replica simulations in the same plot.
