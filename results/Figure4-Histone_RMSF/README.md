Histone RMSF results
-

The output files of the RMSF for each histone type (H4, H3, H2A, H2B) are found in their respective systems folder. Files containing the average RMSF value for each histone across the four replicas are also located here as well, with standard error plotted as filled colored regions around the line plot for each system.

Protein types (viral, eukaryotic, and truncated eukaryotic) as well as DNA types (widom 601 and alpha-satellite DNA) results are compared in the RMSF residue plots.
